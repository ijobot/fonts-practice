This was a bit of practice while I was just learning some early CSS styling techniques.  

I was following along with FreeCodeCamp's "30 days of CSS" on YouTube.  Some of the ideas are theirs, and some are mine.

Again, going back and looking at this now is a great exercize in retrospection.  I love to see how far my skills have progressed in as little as 5 to 6 months.  I left in most of the original code, but recently deleted a few redundant margins.
